For the John Fluevog summer 2018 season, we chose a marketing campaign that focuses on the popular soda shops and drive in theatres in the 1960s. Using this campaign, we wanted to attract two major market groups: the brand’s existing target market who are individuals in their 60’s and 70’s and a new potential target group—millennials who are attracted to the latest trends and also have the spending ability to afford Fluevog’s. Individuals in the older age group grew up as teenagers and had some of their best memories during this time, so the 1960’a campaign will cause a strong feeling of nostalgia. On the other hand, the growing popularity of CW’s Riverdale TV series which features the main characters hanging out at the Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe have made soda the newest ‘hip’ spot for its millennial audience.

We made our advertisement mimic the appearance and aesthetic of 1960s’ magazine/newspaper advertisements by choosing warm tones, a background that resembles old newspaper paper, illustrated cartoon characters promoting the product, and a catchy slogan. According to our research, “groovy” was the #1 most used term by teenagers in the 60’s, a term that means to “be in the know” and “knowing what’s in.” Key factors from 1960s advertising campaigns are that they are straightforward and describe the main selling points of the product unlike today’s implicit advertising. We purposely wanted to follow that and bluntly describe the selling key point of John Fluevog shoes. Our slogan is to get in the groove, which is conveying a message that vintage (Fluevogs) are the latest hip item. 

For this campaign, we would produce limited-edition shoe dust bags featuring illustrations of the two main shoes of this campaign which will be complimentary with a purchase of these styles. Making the bags limited edition tell consumers that it is special and something that is worthy of collecting – much like how many young streetwear brands like Supreme release limited edition drops to convey the illusion of exclusivity.
