The actual campaign by Dior for Fall 2018 is heavily influenced by the 1968s Paris student protests and French New Wave Cinema. Subtitles in yellow font are added to mimic the appearance of French films. One major criticism of this campaign is its originality, which is very familiar to the Gucci Fall 2016 campaign…also inspired by French cinema and uses yellow subtitles in its photos. Coincidentally done or not, Dior seems to be confused in the direction that it is going.

Maria Grazia Chiuri, the current Creative Director of the Fashion House, is the first woman to direct Dior and focuses heavily on about female empowerment and the feminism movement. However, many would agree that talking about feminism is a bit late on the bandwagon, especially with the #metoo movement being last year’s news. 

However, I do like how Maria tries to portray strong women to represent the brand. I would do it a bit different by portraying strong independent women through the expression of art. 
After all, Dior is a fashion house known for its haute couture and strong craftsmanship.

For the fall 2018 collection, I chose the patchwork embroidery pieces to feature as the key item. The iconic saddle bag designed by John Galliano has been re-introduced by Maria in a patchwork pattern and fine craftsmanship is shown in this design.

Natalie Portman, who is Brand Ambassador has stated that Dior is all about showcasing the different sides of a woman. 

Patchwork can symbolize an individual and their different personalities in multiple situations. It can reflect the modern woman who acts differently in the many roles they play.

For this campaign, I am going to choose Mila Kunis as the brand ambassador and the model for my campaign shoot.

I am also going to do an artist highlight featuring Julie Verhoven, a well-known fashion illustrator who is known for doing portraits and illustrations of women. Her art style is characterized by simple lines and a variety of bright colours.

For the campaign film, I will use the same concept with the embroidery patchwork symbolizing the different sides of a modern woman. It will be the same as the photoshoot campaign and feature Mila Kunis and the art of Julie Verhoven.

I will have a series of 15-second short films and a 1 min film. 
The 15 second short films will each only show Mila wearing one pattern from the patchwork, showing one side of her. It will show Julie’s hand illustrating the clothing pattern on her as she is walking. 

In the 1 minute film, it will start as a panel of ‘windows,’ zooming into each one for 10 seconds and showing Mila doing something in her everyday life. Besides Mila, everything else will be illustrated.
