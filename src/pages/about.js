                            She sees fashion as a form of self-expression and art. As a designer, Javia aspires to create classic garments for the <b><i>modern casual romantic</i></b>â€”clothing that is feminine but with a modern edge or detail. She also believes that clothing must be comfortable for the person to feel good and beautiful in their own skin.

                        <p>
                            Using her design ideas and skills, Javia explores new design ideas that strive to be new yet timeless.
