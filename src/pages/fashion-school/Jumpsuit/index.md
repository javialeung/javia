Linen screams summer – it is lightweight, airy and breathable in the hot heat. The woven texture gives this natural fibre a “raw” natural look that matches perfectly with the summer season, which is why I chose it to be the primary fibre of my jumpsuit project at school. I drafted this to my personal size, creating a custom designed jumpsuit for myself. 

This jumpsuit has a simple design but features many subtle details; my favourite part of the outfit is the detachable PVC belt that features a small pouch to store your spare change and cards! I would like to test it out using genuine leather the next time. 

Features: 

•	Square-neckline  
•	Princess seams  
•	Exaggerated slit at side seams  
•	PVC leather belt with little cardholder pouch  
•	Box pleat  
•	Invisible zipper
