Here is a custom design of a jean jacket that I had to draft and sew for a school project. With the weather becoming warmer, I wanted to create a light pastel jean jacket that looks different from other typical jean jackets that one can find on the market. As I had suspected, there were only black and dark indigo denims at the fabric store; but I was not ready to give up yet. I went to Maiwa at Granville Island to buy a cyan dye and dyed my white twill fabric in my bathtub. 

To keep the design minimal, I decided to not use contrasting thread that is commonly seen on other denim jackets. I was happy with the result!
