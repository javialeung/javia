The sleeveless v-neck satin blouse features a reversible tie that can be tied at the front or the back. I was inspired by the big bow that the main character, Kiki, wore in the famous Studio Ghibli film, Kikiâ€™s Delivery Service (1989).  I designed a subtle peplum at the waist to create a slimming effect for the top, making it very flattering on the body.
