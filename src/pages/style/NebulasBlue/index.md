This hat is created by myself and my classmate, Tripti Shetty, for our Trends and Forecasting course at LaSalle College. We were instructed to create a hat that looks like a Phillip Treacy hat, who is one of the top couture hat designers in the world. Featuring one of the key Pantone colours of Fall/Winter 2019: PANTONE 18-4048 TCX Nebulas Blue, our hat takes inspiration from the Northern Lights and Nebulae. Nebulas blue is the highlight and primary colour of our hat that is followed by a gradient of light blue and silver to mimick the appearance of the dust and gases seen between the stars.
