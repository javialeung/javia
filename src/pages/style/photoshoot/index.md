The Rococo period was a time of art, extravagance, and romance—the paintings, architecture, furniture and clothing were characterized by soft pastels, smooth curves, and elegant embellishments.   

This photoshoot/editorial is a modern take on Marie Antoinette in the rococo period.  I wanted to depict the emotions that Marie Antoniette would have felt when she had to relocate to France to marry Louis XVI. Uncertain about what the future holds for her, Marie Antoinette was likely to have experienced loneliness and sadness. She was only 14 years old at the time, an innocent and naïve stage in her life where she was also likely to be hopeful about the future.

The main colour scheme of this editorial is blue tones, since it helps to convey a melancholic mood. Blue represents sadness, but also calmness. The overall tone of this photoshoot is subtle melancholy and hope. 

The accessories and props help to convey the romanticized and elegant feel of the Rococo era.
