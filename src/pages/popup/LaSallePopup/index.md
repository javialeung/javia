Last month in May 2019, I held my first pop-up booth for the school market fair and it was a success! I had signed up just 4 weeks prior to the market fair, which gave me a tight schedule for sewing and preparation time. Since I only had time to make one of each design, I decided to focus on making outerwear that were Free Size so that it would fit most body types. In addition, other items I prepared were: wool and cashmere berets, furry needle felted friends, and also a summer top and linen skirt to sell at the market.

Overall, it was a great and enjoyable experience to talk to fellow students from different design faculties as well as staff members at LaSalle to see which designs they liked and to hear feedback on my garments. It helped me learn about what different consumers are looking for, such as the colours they prefer, common fit issues (e.g. needing a looser armhole for the sleeve on my coat), as well as what was already working well. 

Amongst my designs, the two most popular were the Yume Jacket and the Petal Jacket. I was so happy since I had rushed to finish the Yume Jacket (pictured in brown below) the night before the market. 

I hope to do more pop-ups in the future and this was a nice start for many more to come!
